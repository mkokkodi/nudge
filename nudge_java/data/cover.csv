86072,110772634,"Hi!

I have 1 year experience with Google Places and Google Maps. My current work involves optimizing businesses using Google Places and Google maps. What I do in Google Places and Google Maps is already tested and proven to work with my boss' clients- placing their business in page 1 of Google web search or Google maps for certain search terms that are related to their businesses. For just over a year that I am working for my boss, I personally handled 200 + clients. 80-90% of these clients are already in page 1 of Google web search and Google maps, wherein I primarily optimize Google Places. The clients are lawyers, eye doctors, dentists, plumbers, electricians, fence contractors, florists, general contractors, limousine service, and a lot of more of different industry. Most of these clients are small and medium- sized businesses that I was able to place in page 1 of Google. I would say that I have developed a clear understanding of how to push businesses in page 1 of Google maps and Google local web search results for certain search terms related to their business. Google's algorithm is so complex and over the course of time changes so there are really some things that I admit I still don&rsquo;t know. But I would say with what I am doing for my current employer now, we are 90- 95% successful in placing businesses in page 1 of Google and keeping them there.

I honestly don't know if it ethical to use my skills and my knowledge that I am using in my current job to this position. But if you are asking help on this job, I can help you. But I will be straight forward, I am still working with another contract in Odesk but it is a flexible job that allows me to work at my convenience. I can work 20-30 hours for you every week, from 8am- 1 pm Eastern. I am very much free on weekends. Most of the Google maps and Google Places optimization can be done even after business hours.

I have more than 5 years experience in customer service doing inbound/ outbound calls as well as live web chat and email response. I also have 2 years experience as an Administrative Assistant wherein I make phone calls, create letters and send emails, make phone calls, do internet research and other administrative tasks. I am a fast learner and a hardworking employee so be rest assured that I will render the service that you need. There might be others out there who have a lower rate than me, but I assure you that every dollar you pay me is worth it because of the quality of service, knowledge and  skills that I will provide.

Thank you and I am hoping to hear from you soon. You can send me an email here or we can talk through Skype if you want. My skype id is: ann.evangelista

52074,8039848,"Hello and thanks for taking the time to review our post.

Based on initial description; you need a website to be developed for your Car Dealership business. The website needs to be modeled upon http://www.carsales.com.au/ & http://www.drive.com.au/. Since most of your clients use dial up connections, we propose to build your website without any or minimal FLASH elements so that the website loads fast and has a quicker response time.

About us:
We are an ISO 9001:2008 CERTIFIED COMPANY named Cogniter Technologies. We have made more than 500 websites in various domains and have our head office in TEXAS, US. We are a company of 100+ people and have separate departments for Designers, PHP, .NET developers and SEO 

Have a look at some of the websites which we have designed/developed for our prestigious clients operating in the same domain as yours;
http://www.mywhalingcity.com/ 
http://www.genuinemotorcars.com/ 

We hope that the works mentioned above have been able to showcase our expertise and capabilities in the related domain and instill the necessary confidence in awarding your project with us. 

IMPLEMENTATION OF YOUR PROJECT:

1.	We will provide you with a web design that is highly creative & cross browser compatible and based upon your design preferences.

2.	We will create a theme for the website that will be in sync with your  business goals

3.	We will do the color rhyming of the website in a manner that will help in capturing user interest 

4.	We will provide you with customized CMS so that you are able to create and manage multiple pages/categories for your website;
http://202.164.57.200/segnantcouture/control/admin/index.aspx 
(User Id/Password: admin/admin)
The look and feel for your website’s Back-end Admin is going to be the same while it will be custom designed to suit your specific business needs.

5.	We will provide you Ajax based navigation and image thumbnails as it loads faster as compared to when done in Flash. 

6.	The website design will be verified by major Search Engines like Yahoo, Google & Bing etc. 

7.	We will assign you with a dedicated Project Manager so that you get single point manageability for all your needs

Estimate rate: Our place holder rate is $ 10/hr

73532,7787338,"For the past five years, I have been an active player in the BPO industry. I started as a Technical Support Representative for an internet account. After a year or so, I was promoted as a Quality Analyst. Another year has passed and I climb my way up to a supervisory position. I was responsible for ensuring quality customer service to internet customer through chat and telephone support.
 
Throughout my call center experience, I have developed some skills that have proven to be useful in my other professional ventures. I've been an ODESK member since 2008, and my computer expertise has truly helped. My ability to manage time; learn fast and extract all possible resources to complete a task have also helped me grab major online jobs.
 
If given the chance to get this job, I'll be able to showcase the skills I have acquired all through these years. A few of these include article writing, data entry (particularly using Microsoft Office programs), virtual assistance, and audio/video transcription. I am highly trainable, and I can work with minimum supervision. I know some jobs can be real tough, but I can work under extreme pressure.
 
I can work full time at 40 hours a week. If I need to render more hours, then that wouldn’t be a problem. I can also work in any time zone.
 
Should you decide to look into my application and grant me an interview, I will be available at any time of your convenience. I have Skype, Yahoo Messenger, and Windows Live accounts -- all usable for chat. Just shoot me an email thru ODESK for interview schedule arrangement. I am hoping to hear from you."
